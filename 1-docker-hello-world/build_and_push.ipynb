    "The last step in packaging an application using Docker is to store and distribute it. So far, we have built and tested an image on the local machine, which does not ensure that other engineers have access to it. As a result, the image needs to be pushed to a public Docker image registry, such as DockerHub, Harbor, Google Container Registry, and many more. However, there might be cases where an image should be private and only available to trusted parties. As a result, a team can host private image registries, which provides full control over who can access and execute the image.\n",

During the build stage, if a tag is not provided (via the -t or --tag flag), then the image would be allocated an ID, which does not have a human-readable format (e.g. 0e5574283393). On the other side, a defined tag is easily scalable by the human eye, as it is composed of a registry repository, image name, and version. Also, a tag provides version control over application releases, as a new tag would indicate a new release.\n",
